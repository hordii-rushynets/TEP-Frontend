                    "Our journey began in the late 20th century, sewing quilts from four fabric designs in Chernivtsi, Ukraine. This marked the birth of the TEP brand, dedicated to providing high-quality and affordable home textiles. The name TEP, meaning \"warmth\" in Ukrainian, reflects our commitment to warmth and comfort. Initially, a team of 14 passionate individuals produced bed linens in one-and-a-half and Euro standard sizes, and quilts on two single-needle quilting machines.",
                    "We expanded to a larger production facility and main office. The Balakkom company acquired its first four-head computer-automatic quilting machines, enabling the creation of various quilting designs and sizes, including children's, one-and-a-half, two-bedroom, and Euro standard. In 2001, we also began sewing pillows, broadening our product range.",
                    "The purchase of an Italian Mesa multi-needle quilting machine allowed us to produce more technologically advanced and higher-quality quilts. This period also saw the start of bedspread production. In 2003, Balakkom began tailoring TEP brand bed linens.",
                    "We acquired a German Dilo machine for producing non-woven heat-bonded material, significantly enhancing our range and production capabilities for blankets, mattress pads, and bedspreads.",
                    "Balakkom LLC invested in its first automatic line for filling pillow covers with various materials, including siliconized hollow fiber balls.. The idea of â€‹â€‹creating an underwear and sleepwear brand EGO was also born, so Balakkom starts knitting sewing machines.",
                    "Balakkom further upgraded its capabilities by purchasing an Asseline-Thibeau blanket carding machine and Mammut multi-needle machines, automating the blanket production line.",
                    "We expanded our production capacity with two additional machines for blankets and mattress pads. In 2018, we acquired new equipment for filling pillowcases with ultra-fine fibers.",
                    "Balakkom produced 30 types of blankets, 50 types of pillows, 8 types of bedspreads, 20 mattress covers, and 4 bed linen segments. With approximately 500 employees, we became leaders in the home textiles market, earning numerous \"Best Quality\" and \"Best Products\" awards and achieving ISO 9001 certification for our high-quality standards. Our mission is to provide everyone with healthy sleep, making them happier and more successful.",

Always check the label for specific washing and drying guidelines, as different fabrics require different treatments. Generally, washing in cold water with a gentle detergent will help preserve colours and prevent shrinking. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals, and opt for air drying or low heat settings in the dryer to protect the filers. Regularly fluff and shake out pillows, cushions, and quilts to maintain their shape and freshness. By taking these simple steps, you can ensure your home textiles remain soft, vibrant, and comfortable for years to come.",
